I want to share with you the scheme for observations we have used lately.
Of course, you can follow your own procedures. The only critical point we 
should agree is the flattening of the continuum. Any fitting of the 
continuum of eta Car is harmful. This must be done always for the comparison 
star (A-Type).

------------------------------------
1-Daylight calibrations:
We take 100 bias and immediately after 20 dome flats. We calculate the 
median combination of each set, subtract the median bias from the median 
flat and divide the result for the average (or mode) of the image. We use 
that normalised flat to correct for the pixel to pixel response and also for 
the illumination pattern which arrives to the CCD. We have seen some low 
frequency wiggles in the flatfield image.
We have seen that with this CCD, a smaller number of bias images introduces 
noise, limiting the final S/N of the spectra.

When we divide the A-type star image spectrum by the normalised flatfield, 
the continuum is also a straight line and can be fitted by a low order 
polynomial: Legendre 3-5. Of course, we skip the stellar lines to fit the 
continuum, just stating the number of sigmas to reject (normally sigma=3).

2- Scheme for observations:
-eta Carinae
3 short exposures - 90 seconds- to avoid saturation of the H-beta line plus 
3 deep exposures - 600 seconds (H-beta saturated) to get high 
signal-to-noise at the stellar continuum.  With our observational setup, in 
a clear sky we get S/N~400. One HeAr or NeAr spectrum before and one after 
the set of exposures.

Standard star
- 3 exposures of the A-type star. The S/N doesn't need to be high, since the 
continuum will be fitted. The most relevant thing is to put the comparison 
star exactly on the same pixel as eta Car, to be affected in the same way by 
the illumination distortions. we take one HeAr spectrum after the standard 
star images.

3- Data reduction
We use IRAF, but it any other software using the same mathematical approach 
would work well.
- We trace the light dispersed in the wavelength direction and co-add the 
the columns to extract the spectral vector. Tracing the aperture is relevant 
when the spectrum is not exactly parallel to the CCD rows. We subtract the 
sky from both sides of the dispersed light, by fitting a 1rst order 
polynomial, interpolated to the position of each CCD row, along the 
dispersion direction. Only then we add up the rows and extract the spectral 
vector (intensity X pixel).
We extract the spectrum of the HeAr lamp following exactly the same aperture 
used to sum the stellar spectrum.
Then, we calibrate in Angstroms with a polynomial (Legendre) degree 2-3 
(equivalent to Chebyshev 3-4th order).

Since the spectrograph works in a inclined position, there internal, flexure 
impact the precision of the wavelength calibration. However, for eta 
Carinae, this is not relevant, since we know the wavelength of some FeII 
lines, like the one at 4727A and shift the zero point of the spectrum to 
that of that line (measured with a Coude spectrograph, which is much more 
precise). For the moment, I use the peak of that line as 4727.5 - but I'll 
do a better job later...

After dividing the eta Car spectrum by the polynomial fit of the A-type 
star, we get the spectrum normalised in a very precise way. The continuum 
does not follow a straight line, but we leave it in that form. In this way, 
all other spectra, taken by different observers, can be plotted one on top 
of the other just by dividing each spectrum by a constant.

In the past, I felt on temptation to fit a polynomial through eta Car's 
spectrum, to get it straight… however, I see that this is not a good 
procedure, since it depends on where you believe the stellar continuum is. 
For eta Car, we never know where is the continuum….  and specially close to 
HeII4686 there are places which looks like a continuum, but whose level 
changes along the periastron, indicating that they are affected by broad 
line wings. Far from the periastron, the line wings are stable.
